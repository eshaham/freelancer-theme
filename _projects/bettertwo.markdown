description: Created BetterTwo, a social network for bills. The idea behind this venture was to gather a group of consumers together to form a greater power for negotiating terms in reoccuring consumer services transactions. We managed to show initial traction of roughly 7000 local users, but failed to raise a seed round. The website is no longer active.
